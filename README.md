NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT

# Node Angular Starter

I created this as a base for any project that uses a Node.js / Express backend and an AngularJS frontend. I wanted a build process that took care of all the difficult things for me and just let me do my work.

//TODO: more description

## Setting Up

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally:

```sh
$ sudo npm -g install bower gulp
```

Clone the Git repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/kylepixel/node-angular-starter
$ cd node-angular-starter
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Now everything's set up and ready to go. Check the sections below for how to build the project and run the server.

## Build Process

This project uses Gulp for its build process and has a number of commands. The following command will build the project for production. This means concatenating and minifying all source files into a single JS file and a single CSS file, as well as compressing image assets:

```sh
$ gulp compile
```

The default Gulp command also runs the compile task and is exactly equivalent to the above:

```sh
$ gulp
```

The following command will build the project for development. This means that all files will be kept separate (except for CSS) and will remain untouched.

```sh
$ gulp build
```

//TODO

```sh
$ gulp watch
```

//TODO

```sh
$ gulp serve
```

//TODO

### Build Configuration

The `build.config.js` file in the project root contains configurable properties that are used in the project's build process. These properties will be reviewed here.

`vendor_dir`: The directory in whic
`vendor_files`: .

`build_dir`: 
`compile_dir`: 

## Running the Server

The server can be started with the following command:

```sh
$ npm start [--dev] [--port=<port>]
```

If the `--dev` flag is included, the server will be started in development mode and will serve files generated by the `gulp build` command which are in the `/build` directory by default. If the flag is not included, the server will start in production mode and will serve files generated by the `gulp compile` command which are in the `/dist` directory by default.

If the `--port` flag is included with a valid port number, the server will be started on the specified port. Otherwise, it will start on the default port which is defined in the config section of `package.json`.

When you load your page, click the Live Reload icon in your toolbar and
everything should work.

## Making Changes

//- new bower file, add to vendor_files on build.config.js
//- all LESS files derived from source_files.less.entry, anything not here or imported will not be included
//- module dependencies are important
