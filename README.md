# Node Angular Starter

Description.

## Setting Up

Install Node.js then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/kylepixel/node-angular-starter
$ cd node-angular-starter
$ sudo npm -g install bower gulp
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp serve
```

Finally, open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Purpose

Content ... : [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
[Angular UI](http://angular-ui.github.io),
[Angular Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap),
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome), and
[LESS](http://lesscss.org). Lastly, it contains a sophisticated
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) build system.

## Philosophy

The principal goal of `node-angular-start` is to set projects up for long-term
success. ... more

TODO: Integrate Karma.

- Properly orchestrated modules to encourage drag-and-drop component re-use.
- Tests exist alongside the component they are testing with no separate `test`
  directory required; the build process should be sophisticated enough to handle
  this.
- The build system should work without involvement from the developer. It should
  do what needs to be done, while staying out of the way.
- Integration with popular tools like Bower and LESS.
- A directory structure that is cogent, meaningful to new team members, and
  supporting of the above points. (TODO:scalable and logical)

## Learn

### Overall Directory Structure

At a high level, the structure looks roughly like this:

```
node-angular-start/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app logic>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- common/
  |  |  |- <reusable code>
  |  |- less/
  |  |  |- main.less
  |- server/
  |  |- server.js
  |  |- api/
  |  |  |- ...
  |- .jshintrc
  |- bower.json
  |- build.config.js
  |- gulpfile.js
  |- package.json
```

What follows is a brief description of each entry, but most directories contain
their own `README.md` file with additional documentation, so browse around to
learn more.

- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `vendor/` - third-party libraries. [Bower](http://bower.io) will install
  packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually added
  to `build.config.js` and `karma/karma-unit.js` to be picked up by the build
  system.
- `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install
  components into the `vendor/` directory.
- `bower.json` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the
  list of Bower dependencies we need.
- `build.config.js` - our customizable build settings; see "The Build System"
  below.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script; see "The Build System" below.
- `module.prefix` and `module.suffix` - our compiled application script is
  wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a
  self-executing anonymous function to ensure no clashes with other libraries.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our
  NPM dependencies are listed here.


## The Build System

The best way to learn about the build system is by familiarizing yourself with
Gulp and then reading through the heavily documented build script,
`gulpfile.js`. What follows in this section is a quick introduction to the
tasks provided and should be plenty to get you started.

* `delta:gruntfile` - When `Gruntfile.js` changes, this task runs the linter
  (`jshint`) on that one file and reloads the configuration.
* `delta:assets` - When any file within `src/assets/` changes, all asset files
  are copied to `build/assets/`.

As covered in the previous section, `gulp watch` will execute a full build
up-front and then run any of the aforementioned `delta:*` tasks as needed to
ensure the fastest possible build. So whenever you're working on your project,
start with:

```sh
$ gulp watch
```

And everything will be done automatically!

### Build vs. Compile

To make the build even faster, tasks are placed into two categories: build and
compile. The build tasks (like those we've been discussing) are the minimal
tasks required to run your app during development.

Compile tasks, however, get your app ready for production. The compile tasks
include concatenation, minification, compression, etc. These tasks take a little
bit longer to run and are not at all necessary for development so are not called
automatically during build or watch.

To initiate a full compile, you simply run the default task:

```sh
$ gulp compile
```

This will perform a build and then a compile. The compiled site - ready for
uploading to the server! - is located in `bin/`, taking a cue from
traditional software development. To test that your full site works as
expected, open the `bin/index.html` file in your browser. Voila!

### Live Reload

`node-angular-starter` also includes [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/), so you no
longer have to refresh your page after making changes! You need a Live Reload
browser plugin for this:

- Chrome - [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
- Firefox - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.8/LiveReload-2.0.8.xpi)
- Safari - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.9/LiveReload-2.0.9.safariextz)
- Internet Explorer - N/A

When you load your page, click the Live Reload icon in your toolbar and
everything should work.

## Roadmap

I'd like it to be a little simpler. I want this to be a universal starting
point. If someone is starting a new AngularJS project, she should be able to
clone, merge, or download its source and immediately start doing what she needs
without renaming a bunch of files and methods or deleting spare parts. What I
have works for a first release, but I just think there is a little too much here
right now.

### To Do

See the [issues list](http://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate/issues). And
feel free to submit your own!

### Contributing

This is an opinionated kickstarter, but the opinions are fluid and
evidence-based. Don't like the way I did something? Think you know of a better
way? Have an idea to make this more useful? Let me know! You can contact me
through all the usual channels or you can open an issue on the GitHub page. If
you're feeling ambitious, you can even submit a pull request - how thoughtful
of you!
